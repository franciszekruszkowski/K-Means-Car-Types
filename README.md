# K-Means-Car-Types
we consider a set of observations on a number of silhouettes related to different type of vehicles, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. Each vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles. The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance, skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and compactness.
